## Inspiration
With Retail Investment taking a storm in the world of finance. We decided to take a look at how social media texting affects market prices.

## What it does
It basically graphs the word count of a particular company and displays a graph of that company stock over a particular time with value added sentimental analysis of the tweets.

## How we built it
Using streamlit we displayed the graphs and using the yfinance module and Twitter API got the word count and the stock data.

## What we learned
It was our first time deploying and understanding data in hand and analysing it through the lens of an analyst. We got to know how streamlit functions and API's can be leveraged in a better manner.
