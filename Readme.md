## Inspiration
With Retail Investment taking a storm in the world of finance. We decided to take a look at how social media texting affects market prices.
## What it does
It basically graphs the word count of a particular company and displays a graph of that company stock over a particular time.
## How we built it
Using streamlit we displayed the graphs and using the yfinance module and Twitter API got the word count and the stock data.
## Challenges we ran into
Initially, we planned to use the Reddit API for the word count but the usage was deprecated and there were no other alternatives left for us.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
With the time crunch and only basic knowledge, we are proud that we could take this mammoth task.
## What we learned
It was our first time deploying and understanding data in hand and analysing it through the lens of an analyst. We got to know how streamlit functions and API's can be leveraged in a better manner.
## What's next for RetStock
We want to refine it further by providing more key-value insights like the volume traded and the price fluctuation in a better manner.
